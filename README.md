# pyify-unix
Convert UNIX commands to executable Python.

### Use case
1. You have a Python project, want to use a common UNIX program like grep or sed, and don't feel like learning how to do that in Python.
2. You are writing a command line interface in Python that uses UNIX programs to do the heavy lifting

Both use cases come up often in my workflow so it made sense to write a short script for this.
